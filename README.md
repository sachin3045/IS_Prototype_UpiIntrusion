Topic : UPI Intrusion

It deals with the security threat that occurs when we make any payment using UPI specially in a location which is crowded. There is a possibility that your PIN might get exposed and someone might know it. It is quite underrated as far as I have observed but It can pose a serious threat as someone knowing your PIN if steals your device can have access to all your money really quickly and there is very less time for us to react about the event and do something.

Now Moving on to our solution :

We propose a system which can generate One Time Pins using our original UPI PIN and which we can use wherever we want and the benefit that we are getting from it is even if our pin gets exposed, we are still safe and secure because our original UPI Pin is still safe and our One Time Pin that we generated is expired after using it.

To provide the basic model of our solution,
We are developing a Program using C++ which shows the process that actual system would have :
